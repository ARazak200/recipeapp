        ingredientList: "500g potatoes, Maris Piper or King Edwards, cut into even-sized chunks\n3 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs\n1 tbsp plain flour\n\nFor the filling\n\n3 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for frying\n1 small red onion, finely chopped\n20g fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated\n1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped\n½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder\n½ tsp garam masala\n1 tsp ground cumin\n1 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or juice of ½ lemon\n75g frozen peas\n2 tbsp chopped coriander",
        methodList: "STEP 1\n\nBring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the potatoes until tender when pierced with a knife. Drain the potatoes, then mash and leave to cool before stirring in the breadcrumbs and flour.\nSTEP 2\n\nNow, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onion until softened. Stir in the ginger, green chilli, spices and mango powder, then add the frozen peas.\nSTEP 3\n\nCook over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the peas have defrosted and are tender. Remove from the heat, then roughly crush the peas with a fork and stir in the chopped coriander. Leave to cool.\nSTEP 4\n\nDivide the potato mixture into nine portions with wet hands. Flatten a portion into a 5cm diameter disc with a thickness of 1cm in your palm. Put a teaspoon of the spiced pea filling in the centre of the disc, then gently bring the mashed potato around the filling so it's completely encased. Flatten the ‘tikki’ so that it resembles a patty. Repeat with the remaining potato and filling, then arrange on a baking tray and chill for 20-30 mins to firm up.\nSTEP 5\n\nHeat 6-8 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan or on a griddle and cook the tikkis in batches over a medium heat until golden and crisp. Serve straight away with tamarind and date sauce and coriander relish",

Use a spoon to carefully drop the ball into the oil.\n    STEP 5\n\n    Fry for about 4 mins until golden and crispy, then taste to test for seasoning and consistency. You may also need to add a little water or gram our to the mixture at this point if your tester ball didn’t hold together.

Bring to the boil, then scatter in the rice and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 40 mins, stirring often to prevent the rice scorching on the base of the pan, until the rice has broken down and is very soft.\n    STEP 3\n\n    Stir in the sugar and continue to cook until it has dissolved. Scoop out the cardamom pods using a slotted spoon and discard these.\n    STEP 4\n\n    Stir in the cream, then slowly add the rosewater and enough of the saffron and its soaking liquid to just lightly flavour the kheer.
